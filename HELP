Key Bindings:
	Ctrl+r: 
		Request the current "edit buffer" from the evolver.
		This will grab the current "patch" from the evolver and update the state of this software to reflect the settings in the evolver.
		You must have both the MIDI input and output of the evolver routed into the evolver_editor software for this to work.
	Ctrl+<number>:
		This will make the software display a specific tab.  To get to the first tab, use Ctrl+1, the second tab, use Ctrl+2, etc.
