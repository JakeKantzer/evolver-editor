This is an editor for the Dave Smith Instrument's Evolver synthesizer.
It was developed for the tabletop version, but I figure it should work for the
keyboard version as well.

Donations:
	If you find this useful I would really appreciate your support through a
	small donation.  As a note, the proprietary windoze/mac only version costs
	$49.  There is more info about donations here: http://x37v.info/donate/

Licence:
	This software is licenced GPL v3, see the file "COPYING" for more
	information.

Requirements:
	This software depends on libportmidi/libporttime, QT4 and
	libboost_program_options.
	on ubuntu: libportmidi-dev libboost-program-options-dev libqt4-dev

Building/Installing:
	If you want to install somewhere other than /usr/local/bin then edit:
	evolver_editor.pro 
	Then, you generate the makefile using 'qmake', build the binary using 'make'
	and then install it [if you want] using 'make install'.
		qmake && make
		sudo make install

Running:
	Use the -h switch to find out the command line options.

	To get data from the evolver you have to connect the midi out of the evolver
	to the software, use the -i command line switch to specify the device to use
	for that.

	To send data to the evolver you have to connect the midi out from this software
	to your evolver, use the -o command line switch to do that.

	Example:
		I will use evolver_editor -l to list the midi i/o devices and then when
		I've found the ones I want to connect to, lets say input index 3 and
		output index 2, I run the software using the following command:
		./evolver_editor -i 3 -o 2
